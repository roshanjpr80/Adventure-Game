# Adventure-Game


# Situation 

You are a Python programmer looking to practice writing functions and working with 
conditionals. You decide to create a text-based adventure game where users explore 
different locations, encounter challenges, and complete a quest. You will use GitHub Copilot 
to help generate and refine your code to speed up development. The final product should be 
an interactive command-line interface (CLI) where players can make choices and navigate 
the game world. 


# Tasks and actions 

In this adventure game, the player takes on the role of an explorer searching for a legendary 
treasure hidden in an ancient land. The player must navigate through various challenges, 
make strategic decisions, and overcome obstacles to complete their quest successfully. The 
game consists of multiple decision-based scenarios where each choice leads to a different 
outcome. Some choices will move the player closer to the treasure, while others might result 
in failure or setbacks. The player will navigate different locations—such as a dense forest and 
a mysterious cave—while making strategic choices that determine their success.
